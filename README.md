# IDN_DFS
A repository containing a simple DFS algorithm to analyze an Interactive Digital Narrative Tree.

This was created to analyze branching narrative trees produced by humans and an LLM to evaluate the number of unique paths as well as the number of semantically correct paths. There are two scripts in this repo: one that performs a DFS search and produces data around a given tree, and one that takes the output data from that search and produces a graph that details where semantically incorrect paths are most frequent. The DFS file contains two data sets - one generated by an LLM and one written by a human author. Both are tagged appropriately.
